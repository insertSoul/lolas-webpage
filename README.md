A webpage about a fantastic cat

This Webpage has been made to practice using flexboxes for a better and more responsive layout. 

I have also implemented more hover functions for better a better UI experience.

Some of the CSS property's may be redundant and could potentially be cleaned up for more readable code in the future

Overall I am happy with he presentation of this and believe its a big improvement from my first website.

I would like to learn to make this webpage work on other screen sizes (mobile and tablets) in the future.
